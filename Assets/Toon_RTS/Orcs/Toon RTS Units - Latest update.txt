Toon RTS Units update notes  (20/05/2020)


All Toon RTS Units packs has now 2048 x 2048 texture sets.

Placement bones for Weapons, Shields and Quivers have been added to all packs. Also Weapons, Shields and Quiver models have been added as separate models. This allows easy sharing of this sets of equipments between packs.

Cavalry Spear and Cavalry Archer animation sets have been added to all packs.

All animations have been improved, and the continuity between them.

3 "Working" animation loops has been added to workers for all packs.

Some new extra Heads, Shields and Weapon animations have been added to some of the packs.

The name convention of animations, prefabs, materials, etc. has been unifyied in all packs.


All packs had to be completely re-exported. This will most likely result in having to reassing most of the content in your projects. My appologies to the inconveniences this may cause.
